# Governance Weight Audit

> **Purpose:** Identify token overhead caused by redundant, low-value, or complexity-conditional content in agent prompts. Recommend targeted reductions that do not sacrifice safety gates.
>
> Scope: `Atlas.agent.md`, `Prometheus.agent.md`.
> Analysis date: 2026-04-01.

## Methodology

Token estimates are approximate: **1 line ≈ 15 tokens** (mixed prose + YAML/JSON). File sizes measured from current workspace state. Redundancy is classified against `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (shared policies) and `plans/project-context.md` (agent role matrix, now available).

## Findings

### Finding 1: Subagent Delegation Contracts — Redundant (HIGH VALUE)

**Location:** `Atlas.agent.md` — `### Subagent Delegation Contracts`  
**Lines:** ~15 | **Tokens:** ~225  

The list maps each agent name to its role and expected deliverable. This information is now fully covered by the Agent Role Matrix in `plans/project-context.md`, which Atlas reads at session start (referenced in Resources).

**Recommendation:** Replace the full list with a single pointer:
```
For agent descriptions, roles, and expected deliverables, see `plans/project-context.md` — Agent Role Matrix.
```
**Token savings: ~200 tokens** (keep ~25 for the pointer).

---

### Finding 2: Failure Classification Detail — Partially Redundant (MEDIUM VALUE)

**Location:** `Atlas.agent.md` — `### Failure Classification Handling`  
**Lines:** ~14 | **Tokens:** ~210  

The table (transient/fixable/needs_replan/escalate with actions and max retries) duplicates the Failure Classification enum already in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. However, the `Max Retries` column and routing action specifics are Atlas-specific.

**Recommendation:** Keep the routing table but remove the introductory prose (2 lines) that re-explains the four classes already defined in shared instructions.  
**Token savings: ~30 tokens** (marginal, but clean).

---

### Finding 3: Output Requirements Templates — Significant Overhead (MEDIUM VALUE, HIGH RISK)

**Location:** `Prometheus.agent.md` — `### Plan Document Template` (~55 lines)  
**Location:** `Atlas.agent.md` — `### Plan File Template`, `### Phase Completion Template`, `### Plan Completion Template` (~60 lines combined)

The plan document template is defined in Prometheus (~55 lines) and an equivalent structure is in Atlas output requirements. These templates are essential for plan quality but represent ~900 tokens of overhead per invocation.

**Recommendation (advisory only, do not implement without plan):** Extract templates to a shared `plans/plan-templates.md` file and replace in-prompt content with a file reference. This is the highest-impact reduction but carries non-trivial risk — if agents fail to load the external file, plan output quality degrades silently.  
**Potential token savings: ~800–900 tokens**  
**Risk:** Medium — template availability depends on the agent reading `plans/plan-templates.md` successfully before generating output.  
**Decision:** Do NOT implement without evaluating how often plan generation fails when referenced files are unavailable.

---

### Finding 4: Delegation Heuristics — Partially Redundant (LOW VALUE)

**Location:** `Atlas.agent.md` — `### Delegation Heuristics`  
**Lines:** ~10 | **Tokens:** ~150  

The decision tree ("Handle directly" vs "Delegate to subagent" based on complexity thresholds) is useful operational guidance. It is NOT duplicated in project-context.md (the project-context decision tree is about which agent to invoke, not when to delegate vs handle). This section is load-bearing.

**Recommendation:** No change.

---

### Finding 5: Complexity-Conditional Sections — Lite-Mode Candidate (MEDIUM VALUE)

**Location:** `Atlas.agent.md` — Wave-Aware Execution (8 lines), Retry Reliability Policy (22 lines), Batch Approval (8 lines)

These sections are only exercised when plans have multiple waves, parallel agents, or rate-limit conditions. For single-phase, single-agent tasks, they add ~330 tokens that will never be used.

**Recommendation (advisory):** These sections cannot be safely removed from the Atlas prompt without creating a separate "lite" agent. The most practical path if lightweight execution matters is to **bypass Atlas entirely** for single-phase tasks: invoke Sisyphus or the appropriate specialized agent directly. Atlas is optimized for multi-phase orchestration; using it for single-agent tasks is like loading a factory for a one-off request.  
**Net savings if bypassing Atlas for single tasks:** ~5,250 tokens (entire Atlas prompt).

---

## Lite-Mode Recommendation

> Use Atlas only when you actually need orchestration.

| Task Complexity | Recommended Invocation | Est. Prompt Overhead |
|---|---|---|
| Single action (1 file, obvious implementation) | Invoke specialized agent directly (Sisyphus, DocWriter, etc.) | ~300–800 tokens |
| 1-phase plan (clear scope, no cross-cutting) | Invoke Prometheus for plan, then specialized agent directly | ~3,000 tokens |
| 2-phase sequential (no parallel agents) | Invoke Prometheus + Atlas, plan has 2 phases → Challenger skipped, Mermaid skipped, Batch Approval trivial | ~8,000–10,000 tokens |
| 3+ phases or cross-cutting concern | Full Atlas pipeline as designed | ~10,000–20,000+ tokens |

The system is already lite-mode-aware for 1–2 phase plans: Challenger is skipped (conditional on 3+ phases), Mermaid is skipped (conditional on 3+ phases), and Batch Approval is trivial for a single wave. The main optimization remaining is architectural — choose the right entry point.

## Post-Modernization Token Impact (2026-04-04)

### Template Externalization Savings
Atlas embedded templates (~100 lines, ~1,500 tokens) replaced with file references (~5 lines, ~75 tokens).
**Net savings: ~1,425 tokens per Atlas invocation.**

Prometheus Plan Document Template (~55 lines, ~825 tokens) replaced with file reference (~2 lines, ~30 tokens).
**Net savings: ~795 tokens per Prometheus invocation.**

### New Agent Overhead
| Agent | Lines | Est. Tokens | Dispatch Frequency |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Skeptic-subagent | ~131 | ~1,965 | Conditional (MEDIUM/LARGE tier only) |
| DryRun-subagent | ~136 | ~2,040 | Conditional (LARGE tier only) |

### New Sections Added to Existing Agents
| Agent | Section | Lines | Est. Tokens |
|-------|---------|-------|------------|
| Atlas | Iterative Review Loop, Complexity Routing, Observability | ~60 | ~900 |
| Challenger | Quantitative Scoring Protocol | ~20 | ~300 |
| Code-Review | Expanded Issue Validation, Scoring Protocol | ~30 | ~450 |
| Prometheus | Complexity Gate, Skill Selection | ~15 | ~225 |

### Net Assessment
- Template savings offset most new section additions.
- New agents (Skeptic, DryRun) are dispatched conditionally — TRIVIAL/SMALL tasks incur zero overhead.
- For LARGE tasks (full pipeline): net increase ~2,000-3,000 tokens from new agents, partially offset by ~2,200 tokens in template savings.
- Recommendation: the complexity gate ensures lightweight tasks use minimal resources.

## Actionable Recommendations (Safe to Implement)

| Finding | Action | Files | Token Savings |
|---------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1 — Subagent Delegation Contracts | Replace with project-context.md pointer | `Atlas.agent.md` | ~200 tokens |
| 2 — Failure Classification intro | Remove 2-line re-explanation of shared enum | `Atlas.agent.md` | ~30 tokens |

**Total safe savings: ~230 tokens per Atlas invocation.**

## Advisory Recommendations (Require Planning)

| Finding | Action | Risk | Token Savings |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|
| 3 — Plan templates | Extract to `plans/plan-templates.md` | Medium | ~800–900 tokens |
| 5 — Lite-mode bypass | Use specialized agents directly for simple tasks | Low | ~5,000+ tokens (bypassing Atlas) |
