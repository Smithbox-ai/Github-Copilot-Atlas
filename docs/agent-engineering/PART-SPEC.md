# P.A.R.T Specification (Core)

## Purpose
This specification defines deterministic instruction architecture for Copilot Atlas agents.

P.A.R.T is mandatory for all core agents:
- `Atlas.agent.md`
- `Prometheus.agent.md`
- `Oracle-subagent.agent.md`
- `Explorer-subagent.agent.md`
- `Code-Review-subagent.agent.md`

## Section Order (MANDATORY)
1. `## Prompt`
2. `## Archive`
3. `## Resources`
4. `## Tools`

Agents must keep this exact order. Missing or reordered sections are non-compliant.

## 1) Prompt
Required content:
- Role and objective in one paragraph.
- Explicit scope boundaries (`IN` and `OUT`).
- Hard behavior constraints (what the agent must never do).
- Plan vs Act rule:
  - Planning phase: no execution actions.
  - Acting phase: no replanning except controlled `replan` transition.
- Abstention rule:
  - If confidence is below threshold or evidence is insufficient, agent must return `ABSTAIN`.
- Output contract reference:
  - Agent must name the schema file it uses under `schemas/`.

## 2) Archive
Required content:
- Long-horizon continuity policy.
- Compaction policy with trigger conditions:
  - Trigger when token/context budget reaches configured threshold.
  - Preserve only durable architectural decisions, active constraints, unresolved risks.
- Memory notes policy:
  - Notes must be persisted in deterministic structure.
  - Remove stale notes when superseded.
- PreFlect policy:
  - Before acting, agent must compare intended plan against known failure patterns.

## 3) Resources
Required content:
- Domain references used by the agent (repo files, docs, schemas).
- Project conventions source (`project-context.md` when present).
- Reliability gate source (`docs/agent-engineering/RELIABILITY-GATES.md`).
- Safety policy source (human approval gates and destructive action policy).

## 4) Tools
Required content:
- Allowed tools grouped by category.
- Disallowed tool categories for that role.
- Deterministic tool selection rules:
  - Prefer read-only discovery before edits.
  - Prefer just-in-time retrieval over bulk loading.
- Human approval gate triggers for high-risk actions.

## Prompt Altitude Rules
- Avoid vague directives (e.g., “do your best”).
- Avoid brittle micro-steps tied to one exact environment.
- Use stable gate-style rules:
  - Preconditions
  - Allowed transitions
  - Required evidence
  - Failure mode (`ABSTAIN` / `NEEDS_REVISION` / `FAILED`)

## Deterministic Status Enums
Use only the following statuses unless a schema defines a stricter subset:
- `APPROVED`
- `NEEDS_REVISION`
- `FAILED`
- `ABSTAIN`

## Human-in-the-loop Gate
Any destructive or irreversible action must be blocked until explicit user confirmation.
Examples:
- File deletion outside temporary/eval artifacts
- Bulk refactors with contract breaks
- External side effects (financial, production, or data-destructive operations)

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] P.A.R.T section order is exact
- [ ] Plan/Act split enforced
- [ ] PreFlect checkpoint exists
- [ ] Compaction and memory policies exist
- [ ] Schema-governed output is mandatory
- [ ] Abstention rule implemented
- [ ] Human approval gates implemented
