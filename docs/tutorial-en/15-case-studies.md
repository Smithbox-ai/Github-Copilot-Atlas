# Chapter 15 — Case Studies

## Why this chapter

Concrete scenarios showing how the ControlFlow system works in practice. Each case study presents a real interaction pattern with diagrams.

## How to Read a Case Study

Each case presents:
- **Scenario** — what the user wants.
- **Flow** — sequence or flowchart.
- **Key decisions** — which rules or contracts determine what happens.

## Case Study 1: Planner Idea Interview

**Scenario:** User says "I want to add a CSV export to the admin panel."

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant P as Planner

    U->>P: "Add CSV export to admin panel"
    P->>P: Load idea-to-prompt skill
    P->>U: Q1: Which model do you want to export?
    U-->>P: User model, all fields
    P->>U: Q2: What format — flat CSV or with nesting?
    U-->>P: Flat CSV
    P->>U: Q3: Are there any row count limits?
    U-->>P: No limits, up to 100K rows
    P->>P: Map to risk_review\n→ data_volume: HIGH (100K rows)
    P->>P: complexity_tier = MEDIUM
    P->>P: Produce plan (5 phases)
    P-->>U: plan_path = plans/feature-csv-export.md
```

**Key decisions:**
- `idea-to-prompt` skill determines the interview structure.
- `data_volume: HIGH` → risk entry `unresolved` → PLAN_REVIEW activates.
- MEDIUM tier → PlanAuditor + AssumptionVerifier (no ExecutabilityVerifier).

## Case Study 2: Planner → Orchestrator Handoff

**Scenario:** Planner produces a plan, Orchestrator receives it.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P[Planner produces plan] --> Check{plan.status?}
    Check -->|READY_FOR_EXECUTION| O[Orchestrator receives plan_path]
    Check -->|ABSTAIN| User[User sees reason]
    Check -->|REPLAN_REQUIRED| P2[User clarifies → Planner reruns]
    O --> Trigger{PLAN_REVIEW trigger\nconditions met?}
    Trigger -->|yes| PR[PLAN_REVIEW state]
    Trigger -->|no| Act[ACTING state\nPhase 1]
```

**Key decisions:**
- `plan.status` is checked first — ABSTAIN/REPLAN_REQUIRED do not proceed to implementation.
- PLAN_REVIEW trigger conditions are read from `governance/runtime-policy.json`.
- Plan arrival does not mean implicit approval — trigger evaluation runs every time.

## Case Study 3: Orchestrator + PlanAuditor — Adversarial Detection

**Scenario:** LARGE-tier plan, iteration 1. PlanAuditor finds 2 BLOCKING issues.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant PA as PlanAuditor
    participant AV as AssumptionVerifier
    participant EV as ExecutabilityVerifier
    participant P as Planner

    Note over O: iteration_index = 1, tier = LARGE
    par parallel dispatch
        O->>PA: dispatch(plan_path, iter=1, trace_id=X)
        O->>AV: dispatch(plan_path, iter=1, trace_id=X)
    end
    PA-->>O: NEEDS_REVISION\n2 BLOCKING: rollback missing, circular dep
    AV-->>O: 1 BLOCKING mirage: "file X exists"
    Note over O: PA has BLOCKING → skip EV
    O->>P: findings from PA + AV, iter=1
    P-->>O: revised plan (iter=2)
    par parallel dispatch (iter=2)
        O->>PA: dispatch(plan_path, iter=2)
        O->>AV: dispatch(plan_path, iter=2)
    end
    PA-->>O: APPROVED
    AV-->>O: 0 BLOCKING
    O->>EV: dispatch(plan_path)
    EV-->>O: PASS
    O->>O: plan APPROVED → ACTING
```

**Key decisions:**
- PA and AV run in parallel (LARGE tier).
- EV skips in iteration 1 because PA returned NEEDS_REVISION.
- Iteration 2: both PA and AV clean → EV runs.
- EV PASS → plan approved.

## Case Study 4: ExecutabilityVerifier — Cold Start

**Scenario:** LARGE-tier plan. EV detects that phase 2 task 1 lacks a concrete file path.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    EV[ExecutabilityVerifier receives plan_path] --> W1[Simulate walk-through:\nPhase 1, Task 1]
    W1 --> W2[Phase 1, Task 2]
    W2 --> W3[Phase 1, Task 3]
    W3 --> W4[Phase 2, Task 1]
    W4 --> Gap{Gaps detected?}
    Gap -->|path missing| Fail[status: FAIL\ngaps: ["no concrete file path"]]
    Gap -->|all clear| Pass[status: PASS]
    Fail --> Planner[Route to Planner:\nrefine phase 2 task 1]
```

**Key decisions:**
- EV simulates the first 3 tasks of each phase as a cold-start executor (no prior context).
- "No concrete file path" is classified as `executable: false`.
- FAIL routes to Planner for targeted refinement, not a full replan.

## Case Study 5: Failure Retry Cascade

**Scenario:** Phase 3, CoreImplementer fails 3 times with transient.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CI1[CoreImplementer: FAILED\ntransient, retry 1] --> CI2[CoreImplementer: FAILED\ntransient, retry 2]
    CI2 --> CI3[CoreImplementer: FAILED\ntransient, retry 3]
    CI3 --> Ceiling{same-classification ceiling\n3 × transient}
    Ceiling --> Escalate[STOP\nWAITING_APPROVAL]
    Escalate --> User[User decision:\nwait / manual action / cancel]
    User -->|retry| CI4[CoreImplementer: COMPLETE]
    CI4 --> Continue[Phase 3 proceeds]
```

**Key decisions:**
- 3 identical transient failures hit the **same-classification ceiling** even before the 5-retry per-phase budget.
- WAITING_APPROVAL — the user makes the decision.
- After the user says "retry", the agent continues from where it left off.

## Case Study 6: NEEDS_INPUT Routing

**Scenario:** UIImplementer cannot decide how to display empty state in the export dialog.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as UIImplementer
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant U as User

    UI-->>O: NEEDS_INPUT\nclarification_request:\n  Q: "How to show empty state?"\n  options: [skeleton, message, hide]
    O->>O: Extract clarification_request
    O->>U: vscode/askQuestions\n"How should the empty state be displayed?"\noptions: skeleton/message/hide\nrecommended: message\npros/cons per option
    U-->>O: "hide"
    O->>UI: retry with option="hide" in context
    UI-->>O: COMPLETE
```

**Key decisions:**
- NEEDS_INPUT is **not** `failure_classification` — it routes through `vscode/askQuestions`.
- The Orchestrator extracts the full `clarification_request` and passes it to `askQuestions`.
- After the user selects, the Orchestrator retries the same UIImplementer with the selection in context.

## Case Study 7: Final Review Gate — Scope Drift

**Scenario:** LARGE-tier task, all 6 phases complete. Final review reveals that CoreImplementer in phase 4 modified `src/auth/permissions.ts` — a file not in phase 4's scope.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    FR[Final Review Gate\nCodeReviewer review_scope=final] --> Collect[Collect changed_files\nfrom all 6 phase reports]
    Collect --> Snapshot[Build plan_phases_snapshot]
    Snapshot --> CR[CodeReviewer: dispatch]
    CR --> Issue{validated_blocking_issues?}
    Issue -->|CRITICAL in permissions.ts| Identify[Identify fix executor:\nhighest phase_id containing permissions.ts]
    Identify --> Owner[Owner = Phase 4 CoreImplementer]
    Owner --> Fix[Dispatch CoreImplementer\ntargeted fix scope]
    Fix --> CR2[CodeReviewer final: re-dispatch]
    CR2 -->|APPROVED| Done[Advisory log\nCompletion gate]
    CR2 -->|still blocked| User[User escalation]
```

**Key decisions:**
- Fix executor is the phase with the **highest** `phase_id` containing the affected file.
- Maximum 1 fix cycle per file.
- **CodeReviewer never owns the fix** — it only evaluates.

## Scenario Reading Template

When working through an unfamiliar failure scenario, use this template:

1. **What was the status?** (FAILED / NEEDS_INPUT / NEEDS_REVISION / REJECTED)
2. **What was the failure_classification?** (or is it NEEDS_INPUT routing?)
3. **Who returned the failure?** (reviewer? executor? Planner?)
4. **Which routing path applies?** (retry / replan / escalate / askQuestions)
5. **What are the retry limits?** (per-phase budget, same-class ceiling)
6. **What happens after the retry?** (proceed / escalate / user decision)

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing "Planner produces a plan" with "plan approved."** Planner hands off a reviewable artifact, not an approved plan.
- **Expecting EV to run even when PA found BLOCKING issues.** EV only runs when PA approved and AV has 0 BLOCKING.
- **Forgetting NEEDS_INPUT is not a failure.** NEEDS_INPUT routes to the user, not to retry logic.
- **Giving CodeReviewer a fix cycle.** It never fixes — the executor does.

## Exercises

1. **(beginner)** In Case Study 1, why does `data_volume: HIGH` affect complexity tier?
2. **(beginner)** In Case Study 3, why does EV skip in iteration 1?
3. **(intermediate)** In Case Study 6, what happens if the user selects "skeleton" instead of "hide"?
4. **(intermediate)** In Case Study 5, what if the 4th failure is `fixable` (not `transient`)? What does the Orchestrator do?
5. **(advanced)** In Case Study 7, if `permissions.ts` was modified in phases 2 and 5, who is the fix executor and why?

## Review Questions

1. When does EV run in LARGE tier?
2. What does "same-classification ceiling" mean?
3. How does the Orchestrator determine the fix executor in the final review?
4. Why does plan arrival not mean implicit approval?
5. What happens if `needs_replan` limit (1) is exhausted?
