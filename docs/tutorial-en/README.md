## Chapter Template

Each chapter follows this structure:
- **Why this chapter** — what you will understand after reading.
- **Key concepts** — definitions of terms introduced in the chapter.
- **Mermaid diagram** — visual model of the described process or structure.
- **Detailed text** — explanation with examples and code references.
- **Common mistakes** — what is misunderstood most often.
- **Exercises** — practice tasks (🟢 beginner / 🟡 intermediate / 🔴 advanced).
- **Review questions** — self-check.
- **See also** — links to related chapters and files.

## Canonical Sources

All chapter content is derived from:
- Agent files (`*.agent.md`) — authoritative for agent behavior.
- `governance/runtime-policy.json` — authoritative for thresholds, tiers, retry budgets.
- `schemas/*.json` — authoritative for inter-agent contracts.
- `docs/agent-engineering/` — authoritative for engineering policies.
- `plans/project-context.md` — authoritative for agent roster and conventions.

When the tutorial conflicts with a canonical source, the canonical source wins.

## Text Conventions

- **`monospace`** — file paths, field names, enum values, commands.
- _Italic_ — emphasis on a key point on first introduction.
- → — "see also" link within or across chapters.
- Technical terms (agent names, file paths, field names) are in English throughout.
