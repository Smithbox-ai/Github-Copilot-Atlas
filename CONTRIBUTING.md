## Running the eval suite

The eval suite validates schema compliance, P.A.R.T contract structure, tool grant consistency, behavioral invariants, and orchestration handoff discipline across all 13 agents — without invoking live agents.

```bash
cd evals
npm install
npm test
```

All 302 checks must pass before any PR can be merged. The suite runs fully offline.

For a faster structural-only pass:

```bash
npm run test:structural
```

For behavioral and orchestration regressions only:

```bash
npm run test:behavior
```

## Adding a new agent

1. **Create the agent file** at repo root: `<Name>.agent.md` or `<Name>-subagent.agent.md`.

2. **Follow P.A.R.T structure** — every agent file must have exactly these top-level sections in order:
   - `## Prompt` — mission, scope, deterministic output contracts, Non-Negotiable Rules
   - `## Archive` — memory policies, context compaction rules
   - `## Resources` — file references loaded on-demand
   - `## Tools` — allowed/disallowed tools with routing rules

   See `docs/agent-engineering/PART-SPEC.md` for the full specification.

3. **Create a JSON Schema contract** in `schemas/<name>-output.schema.json`. Schema files serve as documentation contracts and eval references.

4. **Add eval scenarios** in `evals/scenarios/` that cover:
   - At least one happy-path execution
   - `ABSTAIN` / `NEEDS_INPUT` / failure classification behavior
   - Tool routing compliance if the agent uses external tools

5. **Register the agent in governance files**:
   - Add it to `governance/agent-grants.json` with its canonical tool grants.
   - Add it to `plans/project-context.md` (agent roster table).

6. **Update `README.md`**:
   - Add a row to the appropriate agent table (Primary Agents or Specialized Subagents).
   - Update the agent count badge if you bump past 13.

7. **Run the full eval suite** and fix any failures before opening a PR.

## Editing an existing agent

1. Read the current agent file carefully. Understand the Non-Negotiable Rules, clarification contract, and tool routing section before making changes.
2. Run `cd evals && npm test` **before and after** your edit to confirm no regressions.
3. If you change output contracts (status values, required fields), update the corresponding schema in `schemas/` and any eval scenarios that assert those fields.
4. If you change tool grants in frontmatter, update `governance/agent-grants.json` to match — the eval suite enforces consistency between the two.

## Adding skills

Skills are reusable domain pattern snippets that Planner selects per phase and implementation agents load at execution time. They live in `skills/patterns/*.md`.

1. Create `skills/patterns/<topic>.md` following the style of existing patterns.
2. Register the new file in `skills/index.md`.
3. Run `npm test` — Pass 5 validates that every `skills/patterns/` file is registered in the index and every index entry resolves to a real file.

## Proposing changes

- **Bug reports and feature requests:** Open a GitHub Issue describing the problem or proposal clearly.
- **Pull requests:** Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a PR against `master`.
  - Every PR must pass `cd evals && npm test`.
  - Describe what you changed and why in the PR description.
  - Reference any related Issues.
- **Breaking changes:** Changes to shared governance files (`governance/`, `schemas/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) affect all agents — test thoroughly and call this out explicitly in the PR description.
