A multi-agent orchestration system for VS Code Copilot. ControlFlow replaces single-agent workflows with a coordinated team of 13 specialized agents governed by deterministic **P.A.R.T contracts** (Prompt → Archive → Resources → Tools), structured text outputs, and reliability gates.

## Why ControlFlow?

| | Single Agent | ControlFlow (13 agents) |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning** | Agent guesses architecture on-the-fly | Planner runs structured idea interview, produces phased plan with Mermaid diagrams |
| **Quality gates** | None — hope for the best | PlanAuditor + AssumptionVerifier + ExecutabilityVerifier audit before implementation |
| **Execution** | Sequential, monolithic | Wave-based parallel execution with inter-phase contracts |
| **Failures** | Silent or catastrophic | Classified (`transient`/`fixable`/`needs_replan`/`escalate`) with automatic retry routing |
| **Scope drift** | Common — agent "improves" unrelated code | [LLM Behavior Guidelines](skills/patterns/llm-behavior-guidelines.md) enforce surgical changes |
| **Verification** | Manual | 410 offline eval checks + CodeReviewer gates every phase |

## Quick Start (60 Seconds)

```bash
# 1. Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/Smithbox-ai/ControlFlow.git
# 2. Copy contents to your VS Code prompts directory (or symlink)
#    Windows: %APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts
#    macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts
#    Linux:   ~/.config/Code/User/prompts
# 3. Enable in VS Code settings:
```
```json
{ "chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true }
```
```
4. Reload VS Code → type @Planner in Copilot Chat → done
```

> **First task?** Type `@Planner "Add OAuth login with Google"` — the system handles the rest.

## When to Use Which Agent

| Scenario | Agent | What happens |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Abstract idea or vague goal | `@Planner` | Idea interview → phased plan → Mermaid diagram |
| Detailed task, clear requirements | `@Orchestrator` | Dispatches subagents → verification gates → phase-by-phase execution |
| Research question | `@Researcher` | Evidence-based investigation with confidence scores |
| Quick codebase exploration | `@CodeMapper` | Read-only discovery — files, dependencies, entry points |

**Typical workflow:** `@Planner` authors a plan → you approve → `@Orchestrator` executes it with full subagent coordination, review gates, and approvals.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structured Planning** | Phased plans with complexity tiers, task IDs, wave assignments, Mermaid diagrams, and mandatory Design Decisions section |
| **Adversarial Plan Review** | Up to 3 independent reviewers (PlanAuditor, AssumptionVerifier, ExecutabilityVerifier) audit plans before implementation |
| **Semantic Risk Discovery** | 7 non-functional risk categories evaluated before research delegation |
| **Wave-Based Parallel Execution** | Independent phases dispatched in parallel, respecting inter-phase dependencies |
| **Failure Taxonomy** | `transient`/`fixable`/`needs_replan`/`escalate` with deterministic retry routing |
| **Least-Privilege Tool Grants** | Each agent's tools trimmed to the minimum required by its role |
| **Context-Efficient Output** | Structured text summaries instead of raw JSON — saves context tokens across delegation chains |
| **Reliability Gates** | PreFlect pre-execution review, human approval for destructive ops, explicit abstention on low confidence |
| **TDD Integration** | CodeReviewer and implementation agents enforce test-first methodology |
| **Final Review Gate (optional)** | Cross-phase scope-drift detection at plan completion; opt-in via `governance/runtime-policy.json` |
| **Batch Approval** | One approval per wave; per-phase for destructive operations |
| **Health-First Testing** | BrowserTester verifies app health before E2E scenarios |
| **410 Offline Eval Checks** | 227 structural + 78 behavior + 63 orchestration + 42 drift-detection — no live agents needed |
| **8 Skill Patterns** | Testing, Error Handling, Security, Performance, Completeness, Integration, Idea-to-Prompt, [LLM Behavior Guidelines](skills/patterns/llm-behavior-guidelines.md) |
| **Model Routing** | Logical role indirection in `governance/model-routing.json` decouples agents from pinned model names. Runtime opt-in (`model_role:` in frontmatter) deferred pending VS Code frontmatter-tolerance verification — currently shipped as logical index only. See [docs/agent-engineering/MODEL-ROUTING.md](docs/agent-engineering/MODEL-ROUTING.md) |
| **Observability & `trace_id`** | UUIDv4 `trace_id` flows through delegation events and all 13 report/verdict schemas as an additive-optional field; NDJSON event sinks under `plans/artifacts/observability/<task-id>.ndjson`. See [docs/agent-engineering/OBSERVABILITY.md](docs/agent-engineering/OBSERVABILITY.md) |
| **Memory Layers** | Three-layer memory model — session (volatile), task-episodic (`plans/artifacts/<task-slug>/`), and repo-persistent (`NOTES.md`). See [docs/agent-engineering/MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/agent-engineering/MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **Reflection Loop** | Pre-retry analysis hook triggered on `FAILED` / `NEEDS_REVISION`; retries draw from existing `retry_budgets` counters (no compounding). Default disabled. See [skills/patterns/reflection-loop.md](skills/patterns/reflection-loop.md) |
| **Budget Tracking** | Optional per-task `token_cap`, `wall_clock_s`, and `cost_usd` caps; early-stop classified `escalate`. Orthogonal to `retry_budgets`. See [skills/patterns/budget-tracking.md](skills/patterns/budget-tracking.md) |
| **Agent-as-Tool** | MCP forward-compatible subagent input contract (`scope`, `context_refs`, `trace_id`, `iteration_index`) preparing agents for native tool surfacing. See [docs/agent-engineering/AGENT-AS-TOOL.md](docs/agent-engineering/AGENT-AS-TOOL.md) |
| **Drift-Detection Evals** | Roster↔enum bidirectional alignment, agent Resources↔schemas existence, cross-plan file-overlap (anchor-map gated), and multi-doc check-count consistency |

## Pipeline by Complexity

ControlFlow adjusts its pipeline depth based on plan complexity. Simpler tasks skip unnecessary review stages.

| Tier | Scope | Review Agents | Max Iterations |
| ---- | ----- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **TRIVIAL** | 1–2 files, single concern | None — PLAN_REVIEW skipped (CodeReviewer still runs per-phase) | — |
| **SMALL** | 3–5 files, single domain | PlanAuditor | 2 |
| **MEDIUM** | 6–15 files, cross-domain | PlanAuditor + AssumptionVerifier | 5 |
| **LARGE** | 15+ files, system-wide | PlanAuditor + AssumptionVerifier + ExecutabilityVerifier | 5 |

Any plan with an unresolved `HIGH`-impact `risk_review` entry forces the full pipeline regardless of tier.

## Orchestration State Machine

> Simplified — REJECTED transition, HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_GATE, and ABSTAIN paths omitted for clarity. See `Orchestrator.agent.md` for the full state machine.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PLANNING
    PLANNING --> WAITING_APPROVAL: plan ready
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> PLAN_REVIEW: user approved
    PLAN_REVIEW --> ACTING: audit passed
    PLAN_REVIEW --> PLANNING: needs revision
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> ACTING: trivial plan (skip review)
    ACTING --> REVIEWING: phase complete
    REVIEWING --> WAITING_APPROVAL: review done
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> ACTING: next phase approved
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> COMPLETE: all phases done

```

## Failure Routing

| Classification | Action | Max Retries |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `transient` | Retry same agent | 3 |
| `fixable` | Retry with fix hint | 1 |
| `needs_replan` | Delegate to Planner | 1 |
| `escalate` | Stop — present to user | 0 |

When any retry budget is exhausted, the phase escalates to the user with accumulated failure evidence.

| **BrowserTester** | `BrowserTester-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 mini | E2E browser testing, accessibility audits |

### Clarification & Tool Routing

Planner and Orchestrator own user-facing clarification via `askQuestions`. Acting subagents (CoreImplementer, UIImplementer, PlatformEngineer, TechnicalWriter, BrowserTester) return structured `NEEDS_INPUT` with `clarification_request` when they encounter ambiguity. Read-only agents (Researcher, CodeMapper, CodeReviewer, PlanAuditor, AssumptionVerifier, ExecutabilityVerifier) return findings, verdicts, or `ABSTAIN` — they do not interact with the user directly.

The `clarification_request` payload is governed by `schemas/clarification-request.schema.json`. Each agent has role-specific routing rules for external tools — see `docs/agent-engineering/TOOL-ROUTING.md` and `docs/agent-engineering/CLARIFICATION-POLICY.md`.

## Reliability Model

| Dimension | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Consistency** | Deterministic statuses and gate transitions |
| **Robustness** | Graceful behavior under paraphrase and naming drift |
| **Predictability** | Explicit abstention when confidence or evidence is low |
| **Safety** | Mandatory human approval for destructive/irreversible operations |
| **Failure Taxonomy** | `transient` / `fixable` / `needs_replan` / `escalate` classification for automated routing |
| **Clarification Reliability** | Proactive `askQuestions` for enumerated ambiguity classes; structured `NEEDS_INPUT` for conductor routing |
| **Tool Routing** | Deterministic rules for local search vs external fetch vs MCP, no phantom grants |
| **Retry Reliability** | Silent failure detection, retry budgets, per-wave throttling, escalation thresholds |

## Installation

### Quick Start (First Run)

> **VS Code prompts directory paths:**
> - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts` (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts`)
> - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts`
> - **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/prompts`

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the entire repo contents into the prompts directory above (or symlink the repo there).
3. Enable custom agents in VS Code settings:
   ```json
   {
     "chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true,
     "github.copilot.chat.responsesApiReasoningEffort": "high"
   }
   ```
4. Reload VS Code.
5. Verify: type `@Planner` in Copilot Chat — you should see the agent listed.
6. Run evals: `cd evals && npm install && npm test`

### Manual Installation (Selective)

Copy only what you need into the prompts directory (same paths as above):

1. `*.agent.md` files — the agents themselves
2. `schemas/` — JSON Schema contracts (referenced by agents)
3. `docs/agent-engineering/` — governance policies (referenced by agents at runtime)
4. `plans/` — plan artifacts and templates
5. `governance/` — operational knobs and tool grants
6. `skills/` — domain pattern library
7. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — **required** — shared policy read by all executor agents

Without `.github/copilot-instructions.md` agents will not have access to shared failure classification, conventions, and governance references.

### Verify Installation

```bash
cd evals && npm install && npm test
```

Smoke test: type `@Planner` or `@Orchestrator` in Copilot Chat — agents should appear in suggestions.

## Configuration

### Adding Custom Agents

Create a new `.agent.md` file following the P.A.R.T structure (Prompt → Archive → Resources → Tools). Use any existing agent as a template.

Every custom agent should include:

- A JSON Schema contract in `schemas/` for documentation.
- Non-Negotiable Rules (no fabrication, abstain on uncertainty).
- Explicit tool restrictions in the `## Tools` section.

## Requirements

- VS Code Insiders recommended.
- GitHub Copilot with custom agent support.

## Design Principles

### P.A.R.T Contract Architecture

Every agent follows a four-section structure — **Prompt** (mission, scope, deterministic contracts), **Archive** (memory policies, context compaction), **Resources** (file references, loaded on-demand), **Tools** (allowed/disallowed with routing rules). This eliminates ambiguity in agent behavior and makes contracts auditable.

### Structured Text Over JSON

Agents return structured text summaries with clearly labeled fields instead of raw JSON objects. This conserves context tokens in multi-agent delegation chains where the orchestrating LLM reads text — not programmatically parses JSON. Schema files in `schemas/` are retained as documentation contracts and eval references.

### Least-Privilege Delegation

Each agent receives only the tools required by its role. Implementation agents cannot access `askQuestions`. Read-only agents cannot modify files. Orchestrator cannot bypass approval gates. Tool grants are declared in frontmatter and enforced by body-level routing rules.

### Adversarial Review Pipeline

Complex plans pass through up to three independent reviewers — PlanAuditor (architecture and risk), AssumptionVerifier (assumption-fact confusion detection), and ExecutabilityVerifier (cold-start executability simulation) — before implementation begins. The pipeline depth scales with plan complexity.

### Wave-Based Parallel Execution

Planner assigns phases to execution waves. Orchestrator dispatches all phases within a wave in parallel, waits for completion, then advances to the next wave. This maximizes throughput while respecting inter-phase dependencies.

### Failure Taxonomy and Automated Recovery

All agents classify failures into four categories. Orchestrator routes each category through a deterministic retry/escalation path. Retry budgets, per-wave throttling, and escalation thresholds prevent infinite loops and cascading failures.

## Evaluation Suite

The `evals/` directory contains structural, behavioral, orchestration, and drift-detection validation fixtures. Run `cd evals && npm test` to verify schema compliance, reference integrity, P.A.R.T section ordering, tool grant consistency, behavioral invariants, orchestration handoff discipline, and documentation drift across all agents (410 checks total: 227 structural + 78 behavior + 63 orchestration + 42 drift-detection). See `evals/README.md` for details.
