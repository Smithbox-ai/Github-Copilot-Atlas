# Copilot Atlas (Fork)

> Modified fork of [bigguy345/Github-Copilot-Atlas](https://github.com/bigguy345/Github-Copilot-Atlas).

A multi-agent orchestration system for VS Code Copilot. This fork replaces vibe-based prompts with deterministic **P.A.R.T contracts** (Prompt → Archive → Resources → Tools), strict JSON Schema outputs, and reliability gates.

## Key Features

- **Context Conservation** — agents summarize and compress context at delegation boundaries to stay within token limits.
- **Least-Privilege Tool Grants** — each agent's `tools:` frontmatter is trimmed to the minimum set required by its role and body-level routing rules.
- **Parallel Agent Execution** — Atlas dispatches independent subagents in parallel when tasks have no dependencies, using wave-based execution from Prometheus plans.
- **Structured Planning** — Prometheus produces phased plans with explicit task IDs, dependencies, wave assignments, inter-phase contracts, failure expectations, and Mermaid architecture diagrams (mandatory for 3+ phase plans).
- **Adversarial Plan Review** — Challenger audits complex plans for architecture defects, security gaps, and dependency conflicts before implementation begins.
- **Semantic Risk Discovery** — Prometheus evaluates 7 non-functional risk categories (`data_volume`, `performance`, `concurrency`, `access_control`, `migration_rollback`, `dependency`, `operability`) at planning step 0.5 — before research delegation. Plans with unresolved HIGH-impact risks automatically trigger Challenger even for small, high-confidence plans.
- **Deterministic Handoffs** — every subagent returns a structured JSON report; Atlas validates schema compliance before accepting results.
- **Reliability Gates** — PreFlect (pre-execution review), human approval gates for destructive operations, and explicit abstention when confidence is low.
- **TDD Integration** — Code-Review and implementation agents enforce test-first methodology.
- **Failure Taxonomy** — all agents classify failures (`transient`, `fixable`, `needs_replan`, `escalate`) enabling automated retry and routing by Atlas.
- **Batch Approval** — Atlas requests one approval per execution wave to reduce approval fatigue, with per-phase approval for destructive operations.
- **Health-First Testing** — BrowserTester verifies application health before running E2E scenarios to eliminate false positives.

## Agent Architecture

### Primary Agents

| Agent | File | Model | Role |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **Atlas** | `Atlas.agent.md` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Orchestrator, gate controller, delegation |
| **Prometheus** | `Prometheus.agent.md` | Claude Opus 4.6 | Planning-only, phased implementation plans |

### Specialized Subagents

| Agent | File | Model | Role |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **Oracle** | `Oracle-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 | Evidence-first research |
| **Scout** | `Scout-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 mini | Read-only codebase discovery |
| **Code-Review** | `Code-Review-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 | Verification, safety gate reviewer |
| **Challenger** | `Challenger-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 | Adversarial plan auditor |
| **Sisyphus** | `Sisyphus-subagent.agent.md` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Implementation with execution reports |
| **Frontend-Engineer** | `Frontend-Engineer-subagent.agent.md` | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Frontend implementation with execution reports |
| **DevOps** | `DevOps-subagent.agent.md` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | CI/CD, containers, infrastructure deployment |
| **DocWriter** | `DocWriter-subagent.agent.md` | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Documentation, diagrams, code-doc parity |
| **BrowserTester** | `BrowserTester-subagent.agent.md` | GPT-5.4 mini | E2E browser testing, accessibility audits |

### Clarification & Tool Routing

Prometheus and Atlas own user-facing clarification via `askQuestions`. Acting subagents (Sisyphus, Frontend-Engineer, DevOps, DocWriter, BrowserTester) return structured `NEEDS_INPUT` with `clarification_request` when they encounter ambiguity. Read-only agents (Oracle, Scout, Code-Review, Challenger) return findings, verdicts, or `ABSTAIN` — they do not interact with the user directly.

The `clarification_request` payload across all 5 acting agent schemas is governed by a shared contract: `schemas/clarification-request.schema.json`. Oracle and Scout do not include `clarification_request` — they are read-only agents whose status enums do not include `NEEDS_INPUT`.

Each agent has role-specific routing rules for external tools. See `docs/agent-engineering/TOOL-ROUTING.md` and `docs/agent-engineering/CLARIFICATION-POLICY.md`.

## Reliability Model

Contracts are aligned to four dimensions:

1. **Consistency** — deterministic statuses and gate transitions.
2. **Robustness** — graceful behavior under paraphrase and naming drift.
3. **Predictability** — explicit abstention when confidence or evidence is low.
4. **Safety** — mandatory human approval gates for destructive and irreversible operations.
5. **Failure Taxonomy** — all agents classify failures as `transient`, `fixable`, `needs_replan`, or `escalate` for automated routing by Atlas.
6. **Clarification Reliability** — agents with `askQuestions` use it proactively for enumerated ambiguity classes; agents without it return structured `NEEDS_INPUT` for conductor routing.
7. **Tool Routing** — deterministic rules for local search vs external fetch vs Context7/MCP, with no phantom grants.
8. **Retry Reliability** — silent failure detection, retry budgets per phase, per-wave throttling after rate-limit signals, and escalation thresholds for repeated failures.

## Usage

### Planning with Prometheus

Ask Prometheus to produce a structured plan for your task. Review the phased plan, approve it, then hand off to Atlas.

### Executing with Atlas

Atlas orchestrates phase execution: dispatches subagents, runs PreFlect gates before each batch, and requires human approval for high-risk operations. Continue phase-by-phase with explicit approvals where required.

### Direct Research with Oracle

For research-only tasks, invoke Oracle directly. It returns structured findings with evidence citations and confidence scores.

### Quick Exploration with Scout

For fast codebase discovery, invoke Scout. It performs parallel searches and returns a discovery report without modifying files.

## Workflow Example

```
User Request
    └── Prometheus (creates phased plan with waves and Mermaid diagrams)
         └── Atlas (orchestrates wave-based execution)
              ├── Plan Review Gate (conditional)
              │    └── Challenger (adversarial plan audit for 3+ phase / low-confidence / high-risk plans)
              ├── Wave 1: Foundation
              │    └── Scout / Oracle (discovery & research)
              ├── Wave 2: Implementation (parallel)
              │    ├── Sisyphus (backend implementation)
              │    ├── Frontend-Engineer (UI implementation)
              │    └── DevOps (infrastructure deployment)
              ├── Wave 3: Verification
              │    ├── Code-Review (verification & safety)
              │    └── BrowserTester (E2E & accessibility)
              └── Wave 4: Documentation
                   └── DocWriter (docs & diagrams)
```

### Failure Routing

```
Subagent returns failure_classification
    ├── transient → Atlas retries same agent (max 3x)
    ├── fixable → Atlas retries with fix hint (max 1x)
    ├── needs_replan → Atlas delegates to Prometheus
    └── escalate → Atlas stops and presents to user
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `*.agent.md` files to your VS Code prompts directory.
3. Reload VS Code.

## Configuration

### VS Code Settings

```json
{
  "chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.responsesApiReasoningEffort": "high"
}
```

### Adding Custom Agents

**Quick method:** Create a new `.agent.md` file following the P.A.R.T structure (Prompt → Archive → Resources → Tools).

**Manual method:** Copy an existing agent file (e.g., `Sisyphus-subagent.agent.md`) and modify the sections for your use case.

Every custom agent should include:
- A JSON Schema output contract in `schemas/`.
- Non-Negotiable Rules (no fabrication, abstain on uncertainty).
- Explicit tool restrictions in the `## Tools` section.

## Requirements

- VS Code Insiders recommended.
- GitHub Copilot with custom agent support.

## What Changed (Fork vs Upstream)

## Migration Status

P.A.R.T migration complete. Full compliance revision applied. All 11 agents now have:
- P.A.R.T instruction architecture (section order compliant)
- JSON Schema 2020-12 output contracts
- Explicit abstention paths for low confidence
- Failure classification taxonomy for automated routing
- Non-Negotiable Rules (no fabrication, no code generation without evidence)
- PreFlect checkpoints (8/8 subagents + Atlas + Prometheus)
- Human approval gates (explicit or delegated statements in all 10 agents)
- Clarification triggers aligned to `CLARIFICATION-POLICY.md` (5 mandatory classes)
- External tool routing rules aligned to `TOOL-ROUTING.md` (role-specific for all agents with external tools)
- Centralized clarification ownership (Prometheus/Atlas own `askQuestions`; subagents return `NEEDS_INPUT` or `ABSTAIN`)

Phase 4 (repo-local skills) was evaluated and skipped — Phases 1–3b reduced cross-agent duplication to manageable levels. Shared policies were extracted to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and identical Uncertainty Protocol blocks across 5 acting agents were compressed to canonical policy pointers.

See `docs/agent-engineering/COMPLIANCE-GAPS.md` for the original audit baseline.

> Core contracts prioritize strict schema outputs. This is a controlled breaking change for consumers expecting free-form output. See `docs/agent-engineering/MIGRATION-CORE-FIRST.md`.
