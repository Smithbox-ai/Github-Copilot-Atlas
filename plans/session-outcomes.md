## Entry

**Plan ID:** `orchestrator-review-model-routing-fix-plan-revised-v2`  
**Date:** `2026-05-01`  
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`  
**Total Phases:** `4 / 4`  

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Iteration 2 approved after the target-agent field and fallback assumptions were gated by evidence |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Iteration 2 approved the revised plan; MEDIUM tier, no ExecutabilityVerifier required |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier - not in scope per `governance/runtime-policy.json` |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Phases 1-4 approved; validated blocking issues: 0 at completion; full `cd evals && npm test` passed |

**Total review iterations:** `2` / `5`  
**Convergence:** `Converged`  

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 1` (`0%`)  

### Lessons Learned

1. Runtime model routing tests should derive expected primary and fallback values from `governance/model-routing.json`, not duplicate model strings in assertions.
2. `model_unavailable` handling must select the configured role fallback and must not silently inherit the parent agent's frontmatter model.
3. Plan revisions that intentionally share active plan surfaces need a scoped `shared_anchor_map` before the full eval suite can pass Pass 10.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `repo-health-traceability-plan-v5`  
**Date:** `2026-04-25`  
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`  
**Total Phases:** `6 / 6`  

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | MEDIUM PLAN_REVIEW completed for v5; no blocking mirages remained before execution |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | v5 plan approved for execution |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier - not in scope per `governance/runtime-policy.json` |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Phases 0-5 approved; validated blocking issues: 0; final review gate skipped by MEDIUM policy |

**Total review iterations:** `1` / `5`  
**Convergence:** `Converged`  

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 0` (`0%`)  

### Lessons Learned

1. Pass 10 `Files:` bullets require strict path-token discipline: backtick only actual create/modify/move targets.
2. New eval tests must be wired into the explicit `evals/package.json` test chain; the suite does not glob-discover them.
3. Operator health checks are safest as deterministic soft warnings, with hard failure paths constrained to fixture tests.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `comprehensive-orchestration-audit-improvement-plan`  
**Date:** `2026-04-25`  
**Complexity Tier:** `LARGE`  
**Total Phases:** `8 / 8`  

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | LARGE PLAN_REVIEW completed after revisions; no blocking mirages remained before execution |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | LARGE PLAN_REVIEW approved after revisions |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | PASS | LARGE PLAN_REVIEW executability gate passed |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Phases 3-8 and final scope approved; validated blocking issues: 0 |

**Total review iterations:** `completed before implementation` / `5`  
**Convergence:** `Converged`  

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 0` (`0%`)  

### Lessons Learned

1. Presence-only schema checks can miss semantic coverage gaps; Planner `risk_review` now needs exact-category fixtures for missing and duplicate categories.
2. Browser-oriented agent prompts should describe executable harness boundaries explicitly when direct browser control is not a granted capability.
3. Completion gates should run workspace-wide Problems checks, not only touched-file diagnostics, because policy skills can carry lint debt that blocks a truthful clean-lint claim.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `planner-orchestrator-first-wave-optimization-plan`
**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Complexity Tier:** MEDIUM
**Total Phases:** 4 / 4

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE (2 iters) | iter1: 1 BLOCKING + 2 MINOR; iter2: 0 BLOCKING + 1 MINOR (all resolved inline) |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score 92% (0 CRITICAL/MAJOR, 2 MINOR folded in) |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | Not in MEDIUM-tier review pipeline per `governance/runtime-policy.json` |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED (4/4 phases) | `validated_blocking_issues = []` for every phase |

**Total review iterations:** 2 / 5
**Convergence:** Converged

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 0 (no CRITICAL/MAJOR raised across phases)

### Lessons Learned

1. When folding a PlanAuditor finding back into a plan mid-review, re-check executor-tool fit. AssumptionVerifier caught a doc-only agent being assigned a code-edit + test-execution gate after a same-iteration audit fix.
2. The `cd evals && npm test` baseline already had 11 pre-existing Pass 10 Cross-Plan File-Overlap failures before this plan started; they are unrelated to Wave 1 scope and are documented for a future shared-anchor wave.
3. Test-first ordering inside compression phases (update behavior/handoff assertions to canonical-source references, then compress prose) plus an atomic per-phase commit constraint kept the offline suite stable through Wave 2 parallel execution.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `controlflow-russian-tutorial-plan`
**Date:** `2025-11-25`
**Complexity Tier:** `LARGE`
**Total Phases:** `9 / 9`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | N/A | PLAN_REVIEW skipped — docs-only, all `risk_review` entries `not_applicable`/`LOW resolved`; user explicitly said "Implement" |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | N/A | Same — no triggers met, no destructive ops |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | Not in scope (PA not dispatched) |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | N/A | Per-phase code review skipped — pure docs phases produce no executable code; quality verified via direct file inspection |

**Total review iterations:** `0` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged` (no review loop required)

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 0` (`N/A`)

### Lessons Learned

1. Docs-only LARGE-tier plans with all-`not_applicable` risk_review legitimately bypass PLAN_REVIEW under current trigger conditions; document this pattern explicitly in future tutorial-style plans.
2. Direct file creation by Orchestrator is more efficient than per-chapter TechnicalWriter delegation when comprehensive research material has already been gathered in Wave 1.
3. Russian-language deliverables benefit from preserved English original terms in parentheses on first use — improves cross-referencing with canonical English documentation.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `final-review-and-perf-audit-plan`
**Date:** `2025-07-24`
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `6 / 6`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Mirages found: 4 (all resolved across 5 iterations) |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score: 89.1% (iteration 5) |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier — not in scope |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Validated blocking issues per wave: 0 |

**Total review iterations:** `5` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `1 / 3 CRITICAL+MAJOR` (33%) — P.A.R.T. placement false positive (pre-existing Execution Protocol section after Tools was pre-existing, not a regression)

### Lessons Learned

1. CodeReviewer may raise P.A.R.T. violations on pre-existing file structures (Execution Protocol after Tools in Orchestrator.agent.md). Verify via git diff before treating as blocking.
2. Parallel Wave 4 dispatch (Phase 5 CoreImplementer + Phase 6 TechnicalWriter) worked cleanly with no file conflicts when scopes are non-overlapping — but overlap detection still needed on shared files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md verified coherent post-run).
3. Drift check bidirectionality (schema enum ↔ agent prompt) is a reusable pattern — the `validateReviewScopeFinalCoupling` helper in `drift-checks.mjs` is a template for future feature-level coupling checks.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `memory-efficiency-improvements-plan`
**Date:** `2026-04-17`
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `4 / 4`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | 3 iterations: iter1 1 BLOCKING + 2 MINOR → iter2 1 BLOCKING + 1 MINOR → iter3 0 BLOCKING + 1 MINOR (84%) |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | 3 iterations: 65.6% → 60.8% → 84.5% |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier — not in scope |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED (after 2 fixes) | Wave 1: 1 MAJOR (plan-vs-execution scope mismatch on `.gitignore`) → plan amended, APPROVED at 91%. Phase 4: 1 MAJOR (README badge stale count) → badge fixed, APPROVED at 97% |

**Total review iterations:** `3` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 2` (`0%`)

### Lessons Learned

1. When Orchestrator adds scope to a phase at dispatch time (e.g. closing a prior reviewer's MINOR finding with an extra file edit), the plan file must be amended in-place before CodeReviewer runs, not after. Reviewer correctly flagged `.gitignore` as out-of-scope vs the plan text even though the edit itself was correct.
2. Eval count-consistency (Pass 11) is a coupled constraint: any new check requires synchronized bumps across all documents publishing the count (7 files). Plan phase scope must list this coupling explicitly; otherwise executors emit out-of-scope edits that are functionally necessary.
3. Planner `create_file`-only tool surface cannot overwrite an existing plan file. Orchestrator must delete the prior artifact before re-dispatching revision. Consider giving Planner an edit/replace tool to eliminate this friction.
4. Scope creep into `session_telemetry` telemetry surface (iteration 2) was caught only by AssumptionVerifier — demonstrates value of the parallel mirage check on top of PlanAuditor's structural review. Ideation-to-telemetry drift is a known Planner pattern.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `model-routing-stage-c-plan`
**Date:** `2026-04-16`
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `7 / 7`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | 2 iterations, 48% → 82%; 0 blocking mirages at final |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | 4 iterations, 26% → 64% → 88% → 95% |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier — not in scope |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED (after fix) | Phase 2 NEEDS_REVISION (1 MAJOR: frontmatter regex scoping) — fixed via nested regex + Test D regression |

**Total review iterations:** `4` / `4`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 1` (`0%`)

Stage B runtime rollout complete (all 13 agents carry `model_role:` frontmatter). Stage C matrix landed (`by_tier` with 5 divergent + 5 `inherit_from: "default"` roles). Drift-check suite grew 23 → 34 (+4 model_role, +4 matrix-completeness, +3 reference-integrity). Total eval suite 358 → 370, all green. Stage D = forward pointer only.

### Lessons Learned

1. Enabling a previously uncounted drift check (MODEL_ROLE_CHECK_ENABLED false → true) causes an arithmetic surprise: the check contributes a Pass 8 count that was invisible to baseline math. Budget the +1 explicitly in the plan.
2. Frontmatter-scoped regex validation must bound the search to the `---...---` block via a two-step extract (outer `/^---\r?\n([\s\S]*?)\r?\n---\s*$/m`, inner key regex) — single-pass `/^key:/m` is a security-adjacent false positive waiting to happen when file bodies legitimately contain the same token.
3. Iterative PLAN_REVIEW converges in 3–4 rounds for MEDIUM plans when each iteration produces ≥10% score delta; stagnation detection (<5% over 2 iters) correctly didn't trigger here.
4. Doc-consolidation phases (Phase 7) must re-assert every regex-matched sentence the drift checks scan for — removing an older `Eval suite (N checks)` line under an archived section without replacing it under the new section fails Check #5 even when numerics are globally consistent.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `planner-architecture-preserving-remediation-plan.revised`
**Date:** `2026-04-09`
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `5 / 5`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Iteration 1 found one blocking mirage around unenforced eval assertions; iteration 2 verified the revised plan with no blockers |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Iteration 1 returned NEEDS_REVISION with 3 major issues; iteration 2 approved the revised plan at 97% |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM-tier plan review did not route through ExecutabilityVerifier |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Phase 1 required 1 fixable retry for contract completeness; Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5 approved with no validated blocking issues |

**Total review iterations:** `2` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 2` (`0%`)

### Lessons Learned

1. Structural eval assertions only matter if `evals/validate.mjs` actively enforces them; fixture metadata alone is not a regression guard.
2. Keeping Planner and Orchestrator ownership boundaries explicit in both prompts and docs prevents architectural drift while still fixing user-visible behavior.
3. Documentation-only phases still need explicit problems-gate cleanup because markdownlint debt in touched files can block completion.

## Entry

**Plan ID:** `subagent-routing-guardrails-plan`
**Date:** `2025-07-18`
**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `5 / 5`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Iteration 1 raised 1 blocking mirage (Planner fixture owned Orchestrator-scoped fields); iteration 2 cleared all blocking mirages |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Iteration 1 returned NEEDS_REVISION with wave sequencing gaps and Steps sections missing; iteration 2 approved |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM-tier plan review — ExecutabilityVerifier not in scope |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | All 5 phases required 1–3 review iterations; Phase 3 required 3 iterations for semantic tightening of HIGH-risk override predicate and roster drift detection |

**Total review iterations:** `2` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 4` (`0%`)

**Summary:**
Implemented subagent routing guardrails across 5 phases. Replaced `agents: ["*"]` wildcard in `Orchestrator.agent.md` with explicit 12-agent roster and added Scope OUT prohibition bullets to both Orchestrator and Planner. Created `governance/agent-grants.json` as the canonical repo-level allowlist and extended `evals/validate.mjs` with Pass 3d "Agent Grant Consistency" (set-equality drift detection). Added 2 new eval scenarios and 12 new behavioral assertions covering Planner complexity tier classification and Orchestrator HIGH-risk override semantics (predicate: `applicable AND HIGH AND not resolved`). Restructured `plans/project-context.md` with Phase Executor / Review Pipeline split and Entry-Point Delegation Policy. Added delegation constraint to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Final state: 170 structural + 38 behavior + 41 orchestration = 249 checks, all passing.

### Lessons Learned

1. Scenario fixtures that model ownership-crossing expectations (e.g., Planner fixture asserting Orchestrator-owned reviewer dispatch) create false contracts — strict ownership boundaries must be enforced in both code and documentation.
2. "Force full pipeline regardless of tier" alone is insufficient as a test predicate; the compound condition `applicable AND HIGH AND not resolved` must be validated with explicit positive and negative scenario inputs.
3. Governance manifests must be read at test runtime for drift detection; recording expected values at creation time allows set drift to go undetected indefinitely.

**Plan ID:** `review-and-rename-plan.revised`
**Date:** `2025-07-17`
**Complexity Tier:** `LARGE`
**Total Phases:** `6 / 6`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | N/A | Plan review skipped — execution was already in Phase 3 from prior session |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Pre-approved in prior session with full PlanAuditor + AssumptionVerifier + ExecutabilityVerifier pipeline |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | Completed in prior session |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Phase 3: 97/100 (3 iterations). Phase 6: initial report had false positives from transient file duplication; independent verification confirmed 135/135 green |

**Total review iterations:** `4` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `4 / 4` (`100%`) — Phase 6 findings were all caused by transient untracked file duplication from subagent file reads, not actual migration defects

**Summary:**
Complete 6-phase rename migration of the ControlFlow agent system. 25 files renamed via `git mv` (12 agents, 13 schemas). All 37 eval scenarios, 15 schemas, 13 agent prompts, 8 governance/doc files, 4 templates, 2 skill patterns, and 2 package files updated to canonical names. Residual sweep confirms zero capitalized old names outside 8 exception-class files (historical plans, migration artifacts, allowlist). Validator at 135/135 passing. Only lowercase structural identifiers remain (scenario_id, label, JSON keys, $id URIs, file path references to unchanged scenario filenames) — all intentional and stable.

**Complexity Tier:** `LARGE`
**Total Phases:** `6 / 6`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Iteration 1: 2 BLOCKING mirages (ExecutabilityVerifier/AssumptionVerifier as executor_agents; executor_agent fallback audit coverage claim); iteration 2: 0 blocking |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Iteration 1: NEEDS_REVISION (executor_agent gaps, TRIVIAL tier confusion); iteration 2: APPROVED at 89% |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | PASS | Iteration 1: WARN (2 tasks needed specificity); iteration 2: PASS after Planner revision |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | All 6 phases approved. Phase 6 required 2 iterations: Round 1 NEEDS_REVISION for F5 overstatement and markdown lint; Round 2 APPROVED at 96% |

**Total review iterations:** `2` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged`

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 2` (`0%`)

**Summary:**
Full 6-phase LARGE-tier remediation of 14 orchestration weak spots identified in a Phase 1 baseline audit. Phase 2 fixed the TRIVIAL `risk_review` shortcut and `complexity_tier` schema enforcement (261→283 tests). Phase 3 hardened 7 executor/reviewer schemas with machine-enforced `if/then` conditional blocks for `failure_classification` and `clarification_request`. Phase 4 expanded the eval harness (178+56+49 = 283 checks; +44 tests from baseline). Phase 5 normalized operator docs (README, NOTES, RELIABILITY-GATES, PART-SPEC). Phase 6 produced the closure audit mapping all 16 criteria to final disposition: 12 CLOSED, 2 ACCEPTED_RESIDUAL (C5/C7 — executability-verifier `if/then` parity not included in Phase 3 scope), 2 CONFIRMED HEALTHY. Final test count: 283/283.

### Lessons Learned

1. Schema `if/then` enforcement scope must be explicitly listed per-schema in the plan — implicit "all schemas" wording causes auditors to assume executability-verifier is covered when it was intentionally excluded.
2. When a phase hardening operation has a deliberate scope boundary (7 of 8 schemas), document the excluded item and its rationale in the plan to prevent ACCEPTED_RESIDUAL being misclassified as CLOSED in the closure audit.
3. Final audit documents (phase 6 patterns) should include a `<!-- markdownlint-disable -->` pragma from creation when the artifact contains fenced code blocks and tables — prevents a predictable round of lint debt in CodeReviewer.

**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Complexity Tier:** LARGE  
**Total Phases:** 10 / 10 (Phase 4 completed in degraded logical-index-only mode per documented `needs_replan` mitigation)

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Mirages found: 0 (iter 2; 98.8% confidence) |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score: ~97% after document-truncation fix |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | WARN -> PASS | 4 ambiguities patched before dispatch (actor/gate/parser/DAG) |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Validated blocking issues: 0 (Phase 3 reviewed; downstream phases verified via build + eval harness) |

**Total review iterations:** 2 / 5  
**Convergence:** Converged

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 1 (0%) — only one MINOR finding (PROMPT-BEHAVIOR-CONTRACT stale count), folded into Phase 10

### Lessons Learned

1. VS Code-reload smoke tests cannot be performed autonomously; plans with interactive spikes must declare a documented degraded-mode fallback (logical-index-only) so execution can proceed without user interaction.
2. Pre-creating a shared anchor-map artifact is a valid Orchestrator-level coordination action when two plans contend for the same edit surface and only one is active; the anchor-map acts as a forward-contract for the future plan.
3. `validate.mjs` cache at `evals/.cache/` must be cleared (`Remove-Item .cache -Recurse`) to see fresh `Total:` output; the cached-run path prints only `All checks passed (cached)`.
4. When migrating large doc-surface checks, update the `CHECK_COUNT_SOURCES` equality-literals LAST so the equality drift-check does not flap mid-refactor.

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 0 (N/A)

### Lessons Learned

1. Unicode literal characters (e.g., `≤`) in oldString must be read verbatim from the file — using `\u2264` escape in a replacement search string causes a silent mismatch on Windows.
2. Wave sequencing conflicts (two phases editing the same file in parallel) must be resolved at plan-time by assigning conflicting phases to different waves; do not rely on phase ordering within a wave for file exclusivity.
3. When adding CLI scripts tested via subprocess fixtures, setting `archive_completed_plans_threshold_days: 0` in the governance config allows all test plans to be immediately eligible, removing the need for time-manipulation in tests.

**Complexity Tier:** `MEDIUM`
**Total Phases:** `4 / 4`

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | Mirages found: 1 BLOCKING (Phase 1 TechnicalWriter `tests_pass` gate — executor cannot run tests). Fixed immediately as `fixable`. |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED (after fixable correction) | Score 61% → APPROVED after 2 plan fixes: removed `tests_pass` from Phase 1; expanded Phase 4 to 5 drift checks. |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier — not in scope |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | N/A | Docs/skills/template changes only — no code. Quality verified via direct file inspection and `npm test`. |

**Total review iterations:** `1` / `5`
**Convergence:** `Converged` (single iteration with fixable corrections applied before dispatch)

### Outcome

**Status:** `SUCCESS`
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** `0 / 0` (`N/A`)

228 validate checks passed (all green). 5 new Pass 7 drift checks enforcing memory taxonomy, behavior contract, session notes template, Checklist C/D. 79 behavior contract checks passed including new Orchestrator Checklist C assertion.

### Lessons Learned

1. TechnicalWriter's `tests_pass` quality gate is invalid — the agent has no terminal tool. For doc-only phases, Orchestrator owns the post-phase regression check; the executor's quality gate should be `schema_valid` only.
2. Phase 4 drift-check coverage must match every new invariant claimed by the plan — enumerating them explicitly in the phase scope (5 functions, not 3) prevents a MAJOR gap from reaching the eval gate.
3. Cross-plan anchor-map registration is required whenever a new plan references a file already listed in an existing anchor-map consumer. The `notes:` field in `cross-plan-overlap-anchor-map.yaml` makes this rule explicit; future plans must follow it at authoring time rather than at test-failure time.

**Final eval suite count:** 453 checks (239 structural + 81 behavior + 63 orchestration + 51 drift + 14 notes-md + 10 archive + 3 fingerprint), all green cold-cache

### Lessons Learned

1. Cross-platform line-ending bug (CRLF) caught by Pass 12 only after activation � drift validators that parse markdown should normalize line endings via `content.split(/\r?\n/)` instead of `content.split('\n')`.
2. Subagent silent failures (empty response) on long instruction prompts; recovery pattern: inspect file system state directly before retrying � significant work was already applied in 2/2 silent-failure incidents.
3. Plan-contract drift: implementation that lands tests "in the wrong file" (validate.mjs Pass 12 vs prompt-behavior-contract.test.mjs) still requires retroactive completion to honor the approved plan's exact placement contract; the closed-world rule prevents silent reinterpretation.

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 0 (n/a — no CRITICAL/MAJOR raised)  

### Lessons Learned

1. When folding a PlanAuditor finding into a plan mid-review, re-check executor-tool fit; AssumptionVerifier caught a doc-only agent being assigned a code+test gate.
2. `cd evals && npm test` had 11 pre-existing Pass 10 Cross-Plan File-Overlap failures BEFORE this plan started; they are unrelated to Wave 1 scope and remain documented for a future shared-anchor wave.
3. Test-first ordering inside compression phases (update assertions to canonical-source refs, then compress prose) plus an atomic per-phase commit constraint kept the offline suite stable through Wave 2 parallel execution.

**Plan ID:** `post-wave1-followups-plan`  
**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Complexity Tier:** MEDIUM  
**Total Phases:** 5 / 5  

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE (2 iters) | Mirages: iter1 = 1 BLOCKING (Researcher tool grants) + minors; iter2 = 0 BLOCKING |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score: 9.2/10 (after CRITICAL-1 — duplicate retry-budget key — folded into plan) |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | MEDIUM tier per `review_pipeline_by_tier` |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED (5/5 phases) | Validated blocking issues: 2 MAJOR/Phase4 (executor exceeded L289-only scope), resolved in 1 fix cycle |

**Total review iterations:** 2 / 5  
**Convergence:** Converged  

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 2 (0%) — both Phase-4 MAJORs were valid scope-creep findings  
**Final eval suite count:** 477 checks (249 structural + 84 behavior + 66 handoff + 51 drift + 14 notes + 10 archive + 3 fingerprint), all green cold-cache.  

### Lessons Learned

1. Pass 10 baseline of "11 failed" was a print-cap artifact (10-line cap + 1 suppression-notice line in `validate.mjs`). True unresolved-pair count was 27, requiring a 9-consumer anchor map (not the 6 initially planned). Researcher derivation was directionally right; final consumer list expanded during execution after empirical test-driven discovery.
2. Read-only subagents (Researcher tool grants: search/usages/problems/changes/fetch/agent) cannot persist their own deliverable artifacts. Orchestrator-as-scribe is a valid coordination pattern: subagent emits structured findings in chat, Orchestrator persists to disk verbatim. No prompt or grant change needed.
3. Scope discipline in compression phases — Phase 4 explicitly said "L289 only" but the executor performed broader consolidation (table → bullet list, items #2/#3 rewrite). CodeReviewer caught both as MAJOR, fix cycle restored verbatim HEAD wording for non-targeted regions while preserving the L289 fix. Lesson: in fix-cycle prompts, demand `git diff HEAD` line-count target as part of the verification gate, not just a verbal promise.

**Plan ID:** `project-audit-remediation-plan-revised-v4`
**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Complexity Tier:** LARGE
**Total Phases:** 6 / 6

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | COMPLETE | 3 PLAN_REVIEW iterations (v1→v4); iter 3: 0 blocking mirages after wave-1 shared-file conflict, Phase 2 grant shape, MEDIUM diagram inexpressibility, and stale NOTES instruction resolved |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score: 0.95 (iter 3); all WARN items resolved in v4 revision |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | PASS | LARGE tier; iter 3 WARNs: Phase 1 planner-schema exclusivity, Phase 2 exact tool IDs, Phase 3 LARGE-only diagram, Phase 5 double-processing guard — all addressed in v4 |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | All 6 phases approved; Phase 4 required 1 Orchestrator-direct fix (Agent Role Matrix corruption); final gate approved 0 validated blocking issues |

**Total review iterations:** 3 / 5
**Convergence:** Converged

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 0 (n/a — no CRITICAL/MAJOR raised across phases)

Full 6-phase LARGE-tier remediation of HIGH/MEDIUM schema bugs, security grant overreach, docs inconsistencies, and eval coverage gaps. Phase 1 added ABSTAIN to executability_verifier gate-event, enforced validation_status on CRITICAL/MAJOR findings, required `model` on delegation payloads, added LARGE-only diagram enforcement and phase_type to planner schema. Phase 2 narrowed BrowserTester to edit/createFile, TechnicalWriter to edit/createFile+editFiles, removed CoreImplementer agent delegation. Phase 3 added final-review evidence conditionals, CodeReviewer dispatch context, PlatformEngineer rollback enforcement, removed TechnicalWriter test-suite ownership. Phase 4 corrected tier boundaries, non-executor list, and tool counts in project-context.md. Phase 5 added recursive scenario discovery, generic _target_schema handler, 6 new fixtures. Final suite: 399+ checks, all green.

### Lessons Learned

1. Cross-plan anchor maps must be created at plan-start whenever edited surfaces are shared with other active plans. The overlap is detectable from plan content alone; Orchestrator should create the anchor map at Wave 0 before any phase executes to avoid Pass 10 failures mid-session.
2. TechnicalWriter executing broad doc edits may corrupt structured tables (Agent Role Matrix) when it edits rows without reading the full table first. Orchestrator should validate tabular data integrity in doc-only phases by checking row counts against known baseline before approving.
3. ExecutabilityVerifier WARNs for wave-parallel shared-file writes are best resolved by assigning exclusive ownership to one phase at plan-revision time (Phase 1 owns planner schema), not by attempting file-level coordination within a wave.

**Plan ID:** `orchestrator-initial-planner-dispatch-plan`  
**Date:** 2026-04-30  
**Complexity Tier:** SMALL  
**Total Phases:** 3 / 3  

### Review Pipeline

| Agent | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssumptionVerifier-subagent | N/A | SMALL tier; not dispatched |
| PlanAuditor-subagent | APPROVED | Final score: 96%; advisory-only findings |
| ExecutabilityVerifier-subagent | N/A | SMALL tier; not dispatched |
| CodeReviewer-subagent | APPROVED | Validated blocking issues: 0 across phase and final reviews |

**Total review iterations:** 1 / 2  
**Convergence:** Converged  

### Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS  
**CodeReviewer false positive rate:** 0 / 0 (n/a - no CRITICAL/MAJOR raised)  
**Final eval suite count:** Full `cd evals && npm test` passed; validate 270/270, behavior 99/99, orchestration handoff 90/90, drift 58/58, and remaining suites green.  

### Lessons Learned

1. Initial Orchestrator to Planner dispatch is compatible with the project model when Planner only returns a saved `plan_path` and Orchestrator still owns approval, PLAN_REVIEW, implementation dispatch, todo lifecycle, and completion.
2. Regression tests should anchor new orchestration behavior to the named gate section plus trigger and handoff terms; this catches missing behavior without passing on unrelated Planner mentions.
3. New plans that reference shared prompt/eval surfaces need a coordination-only anchor map up front, or Pass 10 will fail even when implementation behavior is correct.
