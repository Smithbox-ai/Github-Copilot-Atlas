# LLM Behavior Guidelines

Behavioral guardrails to prevent systematic LLM coding anti-patterns. Adapted from the main ControlFlow project for Codex (no `NEEDS_INPUT` schema, no agent delegation chain — Codex either asks the user via clarification or surfaces tradeoffs in the saved plan / chat).

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For `TRIVIAL`-tier tasks, use judgment — not every task needs full clarification rituals.

## When to Apply

| Skill | Principles to Apply |
|-------|---------------------|
| `controlflow-planning` | Think Before Coding, Goal-Driven Execution |
| `controlflow-orchestration` | All 4 (during phase execution) |
| `controlflow-review` | Simplicity First, Surgical Changes (audit focus) |
| `controlflow-plan-audit` | Think Before Coding, Goal-Driven Execution (auditing the plan) |

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing any non-trivial task:

- State your assumptions explicitly in the plan or chat. If uncertain, ask the user.
- If multiple valid interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so and push back when warranted.
- If something is genuinely unclear, stop. Name what's confusing and ask.

In the plan artifact, record assumptions in a separate section from verified facts.

### Anti-pattern — Silent assumption

> Task: "Add an endpoint to export reports"

The agent silently assumes JSON format, all records, no pagination, authenticated users only — and implements 200 lines without surfacing any of these decisions.

### Correct behavior

```
Before implementing, I need to clarify:
1. Format: JSON, CSV, or caller's choice? (affects schema)
2. Scope: All records or filtered? (affects performance / data_volume risk)
3. Auth: Public endpoint or requires token?

Simplest interpretation: paginated JSON with auth guard.
Confirm or correct before I proceed.
```

---

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was explicitly asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code paths.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that was not requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen given the system's constraints.
- If an implementation is 200 lines and could be 50, rewrite it.

**The test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Anti-pattern — Speculative abstraction

```python
# Requested: "save the user's theme preference"
class PreferenceManager:
    def __init__(self, db, cache=None, validator=None, event_bus=None):
        # 120 lines of pluggable infrastructure for a single column update
```

### Correct behavior

```python
def save_theme(user_id: int, theme: str) -> None:
    db.execute("UPDATE users SET theme = ? WHERE id = ?", (theme, user_id))
```

Add cache, validation, and events only when those requirements are explicit and tested.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing files:

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style — even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it in the chat / plan notes — do not delete it.

When your changes create orphans (unused imports, variables, functions YOUR changes made dead):

- Remove only the orphans your changes created.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the task scope.

### Anti-pattern — Scope drift

> Task: "Fix null check in `processOrder()`"

The agent fixes the null check **and** reformats 3 functions, renames a parameter, and removes an "obviously dead" helper — none of which were in scope.

### Correct behavior

Fix the null check. In the report note: "Observed potentially unused helper `formatOrderLegacy()` in the same file — recommend a cleanup task if confirmed dead."

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform imperative task descriptions into verifiable goals before starting work:

| Instead of... | Transform to... |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Ensure all existing tests pass before and after" |
| "Add the feature" | "Define the acceptance criteria, write tests, implement" |

For multi-step phases, state a brief plan with explicit verification:

```
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria allow the executor to loop independently without constant clarification. Weak criteria ("make it work") guarantee back-and-forth.

In the plan artifact, every phase's `Acceptance Criteria` and `Quality Gates` should follow this pattern.

### Anti-pattern — Unverifiable task definition

> Phase task: "Improve the authentication flow"

No measurable criterion. The executor cannot determine when it is done, and review cannot evaluate completion.

### Correct behavior

> Phase task: "Add JWT expiry validation to `AuthMiddleware` -> verify: `npm test auth` passes with a new test case for expired tokens"

## Summary Decision Table

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple valid task interpretations | Present options and ask the user before implementing |
| Tempted to add untasked feature | Don't. Note it in the report instead |
| Noticed adjacent code smell | Note it; don't touch it |
| Task description has no verify criterion | Derive one; state it explicitly before implementation |
| Implementation exceeds ~3x expected size | Stop, surface a simpler alternative |
